# Workloads

This folder current holds onto workload generators of particular benchmarks.
Obviously these scripts are duplicated until we finish something more robust
to push through.

## Workload Scripts

Inside this current folder we have workload constructors for:

* `input_stream`
* `decomp`
* `qft`

Each one will have their own required set of arguments and the number of jobs you
want to generate and the steps.

## Examples

There is an `examples` folder that you can use that will provide insight into
constructing your own workload based on a benchmarking task.
